# The-Weather-App-
The Weather App is a lightweight and user-friendly web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches real-time weather data from a public API (like OpenWeatherMap) and displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, weather conditions, and location-based details. The interface is clean, responsive, and easy to use on any device.
